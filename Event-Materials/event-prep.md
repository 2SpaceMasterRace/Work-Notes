**Title**:  

Does OCaml Dream of High performance FPGAs?

**Abstract**:

Come with me on a fun adventure with Hardcaml, an embedded domain-specific language (DSL) built in OCaml for designing high-performance FPGA applications. The talk will cover the fundamental design principles behind Hardcaml and provide a framework for creating embedded DSLs for hardware design. 

We will also **examine how FPGAs work, the current state of hardware tooling, and demonstrate how software engineering principles can transform the hardware design process.**  

The talk will also (hopefully) feature practical demonstrations using the Arty A7 FPGA board. All discussed tools and libraries are open-source and available on GitHub along with my experience and tutorials written down in excruciating detail at [https://ocamlstreet.gitbook.io/](https://ocamlstreet.gitbook.io/)
